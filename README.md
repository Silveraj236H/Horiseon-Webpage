List of Changes:

style.css has been massively reworked, condensed, and cleaned up. 
style.css has been shortened by approximately 70 lines, taking it from 200 lines to 130 lines.
index.html changed to remove certain unnecessary div classes and allow specific sections of the code to express their desired functions.
Unnecessary div classes renamed to section classes which allowed for style.css to be greatly condensed.
Footer and Header were removed from the body in index.html which prevents unnecessary grouping. This change also allowed for major condensing of the style.css.
Hyperlink for Search Engine Optimization has been fixed, allowing the hyperlink to function properly.
